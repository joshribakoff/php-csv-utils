NOTES
=====

- count_chars() will be of use when I am ready to start writing Csv_Sniffer

USE CASES
=========

- user on devnetwork wants to be able to open an excel file and begin writing at the end of it
  -POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-
      - Allow the user to supply an already opened file handle instead of a file name (this way they could open it in append mode)
      - Allow the user to provide the file opening mode in the constuctor or in a setter

- user wants to force a csv file to download
  -POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-
      - Provide a Csv_Reader->download() or output() function that sends the correct headers to force download

- user wants to be able to read & write a real (binary?) excel file with all its bells and whistles
  -POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-
      - Allow Csv_Dialect to have more effect on the way Csv_Reader and Csv_Writer read and write so that a Csv_Dialect_Excel_Xls dialect could be written
      - Extend Csv_Writer so that it has more methods like colorColumn colorRow etc.
      - Integrate library with an existing excel library (http://pear.php.net/package/Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer, http://www.bettina-attack.de/jonny/view.php/projects/php_writeexcel/, http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpexcelreader)

- user wants to overwrite a csv file daily
  -SOLVED-
      - Simply overwrite it
  
- user wants to quote certain columns 
  -POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS-
      - Allow a Csv_Dialect::QUOTE_CUSTOM and then allow Csv_Writer::quotecolumns array

IDEAS
=====

It might be kind of cool if you could provide options when instantiating a dialect
$dialect = new Csv_Dialect(array('lineterminator' => "\r\n", 'delimiter' => "\t", 'escapechar' => "\""))
